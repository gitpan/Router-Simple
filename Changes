Revision history for Perl extension Router::Simple

0.11

        - Added warnings when regexp contains parens.
          i.e. following code does not works.
          /{year:(\d+)}/{month:(\d+)}{day:(\d+)}

          Q. Why don't you croak?
          A. I don't want to break existed code.
             But I may change this feature in future version.
